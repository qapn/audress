## About

Audress is a RESTful API for searching and validating any Australian address. It's designed to work with a flat table Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) database stored on PostgreSQL, which you can generate with the [G-NAF Importer](https://github.com/qapn/gnaf-importer).

The main search endpoint will builds a wildcard query or a recursive common table expression (CTE) query as appropriate, allowing for quick querying against over 13 million addresses.

The underlying raw [G-NAF data](https://data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf) is licensed CC BY 4.0, and is provided by the Australian government.

## Setup

1. Build and configure a G-NAF flat table database with the [G-NAF Importer](https://github.com/qapn/gnaf-importer).
1. Clone this repository.
1. Start a local Redis instance in Docker:
    ```
    docker run --name redis -d --restart always -p 6379:6379 redis
    ```
1. Install all required gems:
    ```
    bundle install
    ```
1. Start the server:
    ```
    rails s
    ```
    You will then be able to see a demo implementation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## FAQ
 
* **I searched for X address/business and the result was incorrect/missing!**

    The data is put together by a combination of every Australian state and territory government along with the federal government. You can contact the relevant state/territory and get them to fix it in a subsequent G-NAF release.

* **I got an error/I'm unable to get this running!**

    It could be something simple! Please open an issue on this repository with some details about your problem, and I'd be happy to help you.
